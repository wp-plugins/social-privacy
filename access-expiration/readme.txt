For each post or category, you can limit the number of views and the amount of time that an item remains 
viewable by each user after he or she first accesses the post.

== Description ==

The Access Expiration plugin is another new plugin from Multinc that adds another level of access control for particularly 
sensitive posts.  For each post or category, you can limit the number of views and the amount of time that an item remains 
viewable by each user after he or she first accesses the post.  Unlike other plugins that expire posts for all users at the 
same time, this plugin keeps track of every user’s viewing history so that each gets equal access time.  This plugin is 
useful for limiting the chance that any authorized user accidentally or deliberately forwards a private post to an unauthorized user.

Because authorized users may have legitimate reasons for accessing a post beyond the allotted time, the plugin gives users 
the simple option of requesting an extension of their viewing privileges.
