Per-post and per-category access control

== Description ==

Based on the 3rd-party [Category Access](http://www.coppit.org/blog/archives/173), this plugin provides the core functionality for restricting the access permissions of posts.  This gives you the ability to permit only specific registered users to read certain posts or certain categories of posts.

This plugin is part of the [Social Privacy](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social-privacy/) set of plugins and it's recommended that you install the entire set at one time to get complete control over access to your posts on your blog.

= More details =

The 3rd-party Category Access plugin provides the core functionality for restricting the access permissions 
of posts to certain registered users.  For each user you can list the categories that he or she should have 
access to.

New features have been added to our version of this plugin to allow access to be restricted to specific users 
on a per-post basis, regardless of the categories. The plugin has also been enhanced to work well with the other 
plugins in Social Privacy. For this reason, our release of this open-source plugin has been renamed Social Access Control.
